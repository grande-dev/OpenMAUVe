# Reference frames
  
## Winglet   
The specific frames referring to a winglet are:   

|  | Colour  | RGB | Axis length | Additional shape |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Winglet (origin) frame | fuchsia | {255, 0, 255} | 0.5 | Yellow box |
| Winglet lift frame | wine red | {114, 47, 55} | 0.5 |   |
  
A winglet is defined by three geometrical parameters: 
  1. winglet_span: the wing span extends on the y-direction;    
  2. winglet_mean_cord: the wing mean cord refers to the x-direction (the center of the winglet (origin) frame is half-way through the mean cord);     
  3. winglet_height: the wing height refers to the z-direction (the center of the winglet (origin) frame is half-way through the wing height);     
   
The winglet (origin) frame refers to the mounting position of the winglet wrt to {O_b}. The winglet lift frame refers to the center of application of the lift force generated by the wing surface. Such a latter point of application is **automatically** defined as the geometrical center of the winglet. OpenMAUVe detects whether the winglet is port or starboard and applies the corresponding translation.   
  
The frames relative to a winglet mounted port of a vehicle are illustrated hereby:   
   
<img src="https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe/blob/master/images/frames_winglet.png"> 

where the origin of the winglet with respect to {Ob} is shown in fuchsia, the centre of application of the winglet lift is shown in wine red; as these images illustrate a port winglet, for additional clarity, {O_b} is shown in blue and the position of the COM wrt to {O_b} is shown in black.  

The model automatically recognises if the winglet is mounted port or starboard and defines a relevant winglet lift frame where the lift force is applied to. This is illustrated in the following example with a port and starboard winglets mounted onboard the vehicle:

## Control surface     
A control surface is a component encompassing two elements, a fixed skeg and a movable fin.
The specific frames referring to a control surface are:   

|  | Colour  | RGB | Axis length | Additional shape |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Skeg (origin) frame | fuchsia | {255, 0, 255} | 0.5 | Yellow box |
| Skeg lift frame | wine red | {114, 47, 55} | 0.5 |   |
| Fin (origin) frame | Pastel green | {136, 231, 136} | 0.5 | Orange box |
| Fin lift frame | Dark green | {6, 64, 43} | 0.5 |   |

The frames relative to a winglet mounted port of a vehicle are illustrated hereby:   
   
<img src="https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe/blob/master/images/frames_control_surface.png"> 

where the origin of the skeg with respect to {Ob} is shown in fuchsia, the centre of application of the skeg lift is shown in wine red, the fin frame is reported in light green and the fin lift frame in dark green; for additional clarity, {O_b} is shown in blue and the position of the COM wrt to {O_b} is shown in black.  

An illustrative example of the effect on a vehicle induced by the deflection of the fin is shown hereby:

## Stern planes x-configuration
The stern planes x-configuration is composed of 4 control surfaces, assembled in a x-shape.  
The specific frames referring to a control surface inherit all the properties of the standalone control surface.  

The frames relative to this model are illustrated hereby:   
   
<img src="https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe/blob/master/images/frames_control_surface_x_stern.png"> 

where the movable part of each control surface, namely the fin, is shows with different colour: starboard top in green, starboard bottom in blue, port bottom in red and port top in orange. For additional clarity, {O_b} is shown in blue and the position of the COM wrt to {O_b} is shown in black.  

Positive deflection of 20 deg on each fin is shown hereby:

## Thruster
The specific reference frame for a thruster is:   

|  | Colour  | RGB | Axis length | Additional shape |
| Thruster frame | black | {0, 0, 0} | 0.1  | Blue pipe | 

<img src="https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe/blob/master/images/frames_thruster.png"> 

where the origin of the thruster frame with respect to {Ob} is shown in black, which coincides with the point of application of the thruster force. 

In the following example, twin thrusters are shown mounted aft of the vehicle:   

<img src="https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe/blob/master/images/frames_thruster2.png"> 

 where, for additional clarity, {O_b} is shown in blue and the position of the COM wrt to {O_b} is shown in black.  s
