## Winglet   
The specific frames referring to a winglet are:   

|  | Colour  | RGB | Axis length | Additional shape |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Winglet (origin) frame | fuchsia | {255, 0, 255} | 0.5 |  |
| Winglet lift frame | wine red | {114, 47, 55} | 0.5 |   |
  
A winglet is defined by three geometrical parameters: 
  1. winglet_span: the wing span extends on the y-direction;    
  2. winglet_mean_cord: the wing mean cord refers to the x-direction (the center of the winglet (origin) frame is half-way through the mean cord);     
  3. winglet_height: the wing height refers to the z-direction (the center of the winglet (origin) frame is half-way through the wing height);     
   
The winglet (origin) frame refers to the mounting position of the winglet wrt to {O_b}. The winglet lift frame refers to the center of application of the lift force generated by the wing surface. Such a latter point of application is **automatically** defined as the geometrical center of the winglet. OpenMAUVe detects whether the winglet is port or starboard and applies the corresponding translation.   
  
The frames relative to a winglet mounted port of a vehicle are illustrated hereby:

where the origin of the winglet with respect to {Ob} is shown in fuchsia, the centre of application of the winglet lift is shown in wine red; as these images illustrate a port winglet, for additional clarity, {O_b} is shown in blue and the position of the COM wrt to {O_b} is shown in black.  

## Control surface     
A control surface is a component encompassing two elements, a fixed skeg and a movable fin.
The specific frames referring to a control surface are:   

|  | Colour  | RGB | Axis length | Additional shape |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Skeg (origin) frame | fuchsia | {255, 0, 255} | 0.5 | Yellow box |
| Skeg lift frame | wine red | {114, 47, 55} | 0.5 |   |
| Fin (origin) frame | Pastel green | {136, 231, 136} | 0.5 | Orange box |
| Fin lift frame | Dark green | {6, 64, 43} | 0.5 |   |
