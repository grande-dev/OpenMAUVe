This folder contains the mos scripts to run the unit tests. 

1) ROGUE glider
This unit test will run the file 'Glider_Lib.UnitTesting.TestROGUE.mo', which is the file to test 'Glider_Lib.Vehicles.gliderROGUE.mo'. To run the unit test:
a) open this folder within a terminal (CAVEAT: be sure to be in the correct folder or some of your files might be cancelled from your system!);
b) run in the terminal: $ omc runUnitTestsROGUE.mos

The results will be automatically saved in the file: "outputResultUnitTestROGUE.txt".
During the execution of the unit test, a number of files are generated by the Modelica compiler. At the end of the simulation these files are automatically removed via a command within the runUnitTestsROGUE.mos file.
