The model TestROGUE.mo allows to perform the unit testing of the gliderROGUE.mo.

The results of the unit testing are available with the variables testPassed_variablename. If a testPassed_variablename = -1.0, it means that the unit test is not performed in that time instant; if testPassed_variablename = 0.0 it means that the test is active but not passed, while testPassed_variablename=1.0 means that the test is active and passed.
Overall, testPassed = 1.0 means that all the variables passed the test in that time instant.
