How to load, read and plot the results of the OpenModelica simulations:

1) From OpenModelica generate the results in .csv file:
-> Simulation -> Output -> csv
(be sure about the path of the generated files)
The results are saved in:
Modelica interface --> Tools --> Options --> General --> Working Directory (usually something as: /tmp/OpenModelica_docautomata/OMEdit) . The name of the file is given by how you define it in: Simulation setup --> Output --> Result File (Optional)

'cd /tmp/OpenModelica_docautomata/OMEdit; nautilus .' OR
'cd ~/Desktop/PhD/PhD/5-code/OpenModelica/ResultFolder; nautilus .'

2) prepare the MATLAB file: reading_plotting.m

3) Setup the csv file and the destination folder of the images.

4) Launch the script.
