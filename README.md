# OpenMAUVe

OpenMAUVe is an OpenModelica-based simulator for complex Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Underwater Gliders and hybrid AUVs.  
  
OpenMAUVe allows to simulate AUVs with internal moving masses (shifting and rolling), Variable Buoyancy Devices, in addition to the classical set of actuators (e.g. control surfaces such as rudders, stern planes and thrusters).

## Step-by-step installation instructions 
1. Instructions on installation are available within the ![INSTALLATION](./documentation/INSTALLATION.md) file.    
  
2. OpenMAUVe runs on `Modelica v4.0.0`, and was tested on `OpenModelica 1.25.1`.  
The software was tested on the following OSs:   

|  | OS |
| :---:   | :---: |
| Linux Ubuntu 20.04 |  :white_check_mark:  |
| Linux Ubuntu 24.04 |  :white_check_mark:  |
| Windows 10 |  :white_check_mark:  |
| Windows 11 |  :white_check_mark:  |
| macOS |  TODO  |
   
3. Examples on how to navigate the file structure, run the models and verify the results are available in the [video demo](#video-demo-section) discussed below.

## Video demo
A two-parts video demo is available to provide further examples and instructions of how to use the software tool.     
[Part 1](https://youtu.be/KwfKjwBRIlU) further motivates the development of the simulator.  
[Part 2](https://youtu.be/s6pP4D50OoE) illustrates how to use the software and how to run the validation models.  
  
The demo was prepared and presented in @grande2025openmauve.  
  
  
## Documentation

Details on the reference frames employed in OpenMAUVe, such as the ECI (red), ECEF (green) and NED (blue) illustrated below can be found in the ![colour code](./documentation/Colour_code.md) file.    .

## Available vehicles 

OpenMAUVe includes a set of vehicles, which were implemented and tested.   
The following AUVs, Underwater Gliders and hybrid AUVs are currently available under `OpenMAUVe.Vehicles`:   


| Vehicle | Included  | Verified successfully | Notes |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ROGUE glider |  :white_check_mark:  | :white_check_mark: | Full availability of geometrical, hydrodynamical parameters and groundtruth data. |
| Seawing glider |  :white_check_mark:  | :white_check_mark: | Full availability of geometrical, hydrodynamical parameters and groundtruth data. |
| Petrel-II glider |  :white_check_mark:  | :yellow_circle: | Full verification not possible: missing deployment data. |

The other vehicles available within `OpenMAUVe.Vehicles` require further development and are not certified to work. It was not possible to complete their integration due to missing geometrical or hydrodynamical parameters, or the result cannot be trusted due to the lack of groundtruth data.
