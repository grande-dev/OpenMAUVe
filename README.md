# OpenMAUVe

OpenMAUVe is an OpenModelica-based simulator for complex Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Underwater Gliders and hybrid AUVs.  
  
OpenMAUVe allows to simulate AUVs with internal moving masses (shifting and rolling), Variable Buoyancy Devices, in addition to the classical set of actuators (e.g. control surfaces such as rudders, stern planes and thrusters).

## Step-by-step instructions 
Detailed instructions on how to set up a new vehicle design, how to run the (provided) unit tests and where to locate the key modelling classes (e.g. hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, actuators, etc.) will be provided upon the public release of the repository.  
  


## Video demo
A two-parts video demo is available to provide further examples and instructions.   
[Part 1](https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe) further motivates the development of the simulator.  
[Part 2](https://github.com/grande-dev/OpenMAUVe) illustrates how to use the software and run the validation examples.
