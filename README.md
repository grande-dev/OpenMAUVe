# OpenMAUVe

OpenMAUVe is an OpenModelica-based simulator for complex Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Underwater Gliders and hybrid AUVs.  
  
OpenMAUVe allows to simulate AUVs with internal moving masses (shifting and rolling), Variable Buoyancy Devices, in addition to the classical set of actuators (e.g. control surfaces such as rudders, stern planes and thrusters).

## Step-by-step instructions 
Instructions on installation are available within the ![INSTALLATION](./documentation/INSTALLATION.md) file.    
  
Further examples on how to navigate the files, run the models, and check the results are available in the video demo discussed below.   
  


## Video demo
A two-parts video demo is available to provide further examples and instructions of how to use the software tool.     
[Part 1](https://youtu.be/KwfKjwBRIlU) further motivates the development of the simulator.  
[Part 2](https://youtu.be/s6pP4D50OoE) illustrates how to use the software and how to run the validation models.
